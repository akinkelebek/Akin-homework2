                <p> The myth claims that the Babylonioans were building a tower to reach the God(s) and were scaterred around the World into different ethnicities with different languages.
                    More credible sources claim that humans wandered around themselves, developed different languages after Sumerian, and Phyrigians came up with the alphabet as we know it today.</p>
                <p> Since then, there have been many translations, such as the Septuagint [2], translated into Greek from Hebrew in 3th Century BC. 
                    Translation of words, signs, and other semantic, semiotic, and of course cultural elements have proved difficult for translators, and they were blamed for missing or mis-translations more often than not.
                    This was indeed a problem, and what corresponds to a positive collocation in one language could as well be otherwise in another language.
                    According to a recently-declassified US document, bombing of Hiroshima occurred due to a mistranslation. [3]
                    Rarely do literary works carry both the same meaning and style when translated. Therefore, the meaning, or meanings behind words/phrases/sentences cannot be carried into the target language with exact precision,
                    and the translator is labelled the "Traitor" to the source text/speech and its author.</p>
